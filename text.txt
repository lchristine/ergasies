The Parthenon is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. 
It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order. 
Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, 
Athenian democracy and Western civilization,[6] and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. To the Athenians who built it, 
the Parthenon and other Periclean monuments of the Acropolis were seen fundamentally as a celebration of Hellenic victory over the Persian invaders 
and as a thanksgiving to the gods for that victory. As of 2007 the Greek Ministry of Culture was carrying out a programme of selective restoration 
and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure. The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena, 
which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon, that was destroyed in the Persian invasion ago. The temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the Hyades. 
Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon served a practical purpose as the city treasury. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, 
which later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the sixth century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
These sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles or the Parthenon Marbles, were sold in 1816 to the British Museum in London, where they are now displayed.
